## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://github.com/brian-reed-software/brand-teck-stack)

This project is going to be Tech Stack Detector using an API, and then it will use another API to see what tech stack the company uses for their internet site. So that a user who is interested in a particular brand can see what technologies they need to learn so they can potentially work for the particular brand company. 

## Built With

This is going to be build with React using Next.js for the Frontend and Axios for the server.

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app.

Getting Started
First, run the development server:

npm next dev
# or
yarn dev
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.js. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/*. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.

Learn More
To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

Next.js Documentation - learn about Next.js features and API.
Learn Next.js - an interactive Next.js tutorial.
You can check out the Next.js GitHub repository - your feedback and contributions are welcome!
